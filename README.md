# Maze Solver

A simple program written in Rust to solve mazes.

Made by combining the wonderful
[Clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) crate for command line parsing,
[Image](https://crates.io/crates/image) to load and manipulate the input image, and
[Pathfinding](https://crates.io/crates/pathfinding) to find the actual path.

## Usage

```sh
maze_solver.exe image_file
```

See also `maze_solver.exe --help` for help.
